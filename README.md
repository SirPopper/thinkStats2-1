## Summaries and exercises from 'Think Stats'

This repository is based on material from the book [Think Stats (Second edition)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) 
by [Allen B. Downey](https://github.com/AllenDowney), available from [greenteapress.com](greenteapress.com). You can find the original text and supporting code for the book [here](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2).

I found that working alongside the book with Jupyter notebook formatted files, helped deepen my understanding of the material and exercises.
